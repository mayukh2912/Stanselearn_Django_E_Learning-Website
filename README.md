## Overview

Stanselearn is a web-based e-learning platform built with Django. It allows instructors to create and manage courses with modules and various content types (text, videos, images, files). Students can sign up, enroll in courses, and access learning materials. The platform includes user authentication, a content management system (CMS), role-based permissions (students and instructors), and features like formsets for managing multiple items at once.

This project demonstrates advanced Django concepts such as model inheritance, custom model fields, class-based views, fixtures for initial data, group and permission management, and handling formsets.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Separate sign-up and login for learners (/lsign/) and instructors. Uses Django's built-in auth system with custom groups (Students, Instructors).
- **Course Management**: Instructors can create, update, and delete courses with slugs for SEO-friendly URLs.
- **Modules and Content**: Courses are divided into ordered modules. Each module can contain polymorphic content (text, files, images, videos) using model inheritance and generic foreign keys.
- **Custom Ordering**: A custom `OrderField` for auto-incrementing order within courses/modules.
- **Permissions**: Role-based access â€“ Instructors have edit permissions; Students can view/enroll.
- **Formsets**: Inline formsets for adding multiple modules during course creation.
- **Fixtures**: Sample data for courses and modules via JSON fixtures.
- **Admin CMS**: Django admin interface for managing content.
- **Media Handling**: Support for uploading files and images.
- **Templates**: Basic HTML templates for course lists, forms, and sign-up.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django 5.x (with class-based views, models, forms, and admin).
- **Database**: SQLite (default; can be swapped to PostgreSQL or others).
- **Frontend**: Basic HTML with Bootstrap (inferred from form styling in templates). Uses django-crispy-forms for form rendering.
- **Other Libraries**: Pillow (for image handling), django-crispy-forms, crispy-bootstrap5 (for Bootstrap 5 styling).
- **Python Version**: 3.12+.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Virtual environment tool (venv)
- Git

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mayukh2912/Stanselearn_Django_E_Learning-Website.git
   cd Stanselearn_Django_E_Learning-Website
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (If no requirements.txt, install manually: `pip install django pillow django-crispy-forms crispy-bootstrap5`)

4. Apply migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Load fixtures (optional, for sample data):
   ```
   python manage.py loaddata courses/fixtures/courses.json
   ```

6. Create a superuser for admin access:
   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. Run the development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   - Access at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
   - Admin: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
   - Learner Sign-up: http://127.0.0.1:8000/lsign/

### Configuration Notes
- In `settings.py`, ensure `DEBUG = True` for development.
- For production, set up a proper database, static/media serving, and security settings.
- Assign permissions in admin: Add users to 'Instructors' group with 'can_edit_content'.

## Usage

- **As Instructor**: Log in, go to /create/ to add courses and modules.
